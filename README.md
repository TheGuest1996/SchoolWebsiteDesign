To whom it may concern,

<br>

This website was brought to you by an extremely passionate group of students.
<br>
We made the website using both visual studio code and the github editor by itself, and optimized it so that everything can run on your local machine, as long as you follow the steps below.
<br>
To run the code, please download a copy of the code by clicking the green button and downloading it.
<br>
The website itself is self explanatory once you run the "index" file, which is also the home page of the website.
<br>
Don't forget to click the graphs to learn more about them (or click the hamburger menu, then the double arrows to go directly to the info)
<br>
Credits to w3 school and their html/css tutorials.
<br>
Feel free to take inspiration for your own website, as long as you credit us.
<br>
Hope you enjoy!

<br>

Yours sincerely,
