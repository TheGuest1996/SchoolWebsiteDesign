        The data reveals distinct gender differences in the use of social media platforms. Females exhibit a stronger preference for platforms like Instagram (99%), Snapchat (80%), and TikTok (79%), compared to males, who show lower engagement on these platforms (81%, 74% and 63% respectively). Instagram and Snapchat, in particular, are much more popular among females, with a notable difference of over 10 percent. On the other hand, Twitter/X shows a modest gender difference, with males using it slightly more (26%) than females (20%). Facebook also has a moderate gender gap, with females using it more frequently (45% for females and 40% for males).

Overall, females tend to favor visual and entertainment-driven platforms, while males are more inclined toward platforms associated with gaming and niche communities.
