    <section id="introduction">
        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>Social media use among teenagers is widespread, with many spending hours scrolling
            through platforms like TikTok, Instagram, and X (formerly Twitter). Concerns have grown over
            the potential negative impacts of prolonged social media use on young people’s mental health
            and well-being. While some studies highlight the positive aspects of social media, such as
            fostering connections, others point to risks lke social stigma, anxiety, and low self-esteem.
            The data collected was from two different sources, one of which was from Generation Survey
            and the other was from Pew Research Center. The data gathered from Generation Survey was
            available through their website. It is a large survey conducted in 2024 to explore the impact of
            social media use on the well-being of young people that targeted 3,785 Year 10 students
            across 340 Australian schools.
            The data gathered from Pew Research Center was available online. The sample consisted of
            1,316 U.S. teens aged 13 to 17, along with one parent from each teen’s household in 2022.</p>

    <section id="limitsbiases">
        <h2>Limitations and Biases</h2>
        <p>Since the data relies on self-reported responses, certain limitations
            and biases must be acknowledged. Research (Boyle et al., 2022), has
            shown that many teenagers struggle to accurately recall which social
            media platforms they've used over a set period. Additionally,
            adolescents often overestimate their average daily screen time,
            leading to potential inaccuracies. Factors like the type of platform,
            gender, and the number of platforms a participant regularly uses can
            further influence self-reporting accuracy.Consequently, survey-based
            studies may be subject to biases that affect the validity of conclusions
            regarding social media’s impact on adolescent well-being</p>
    </section>

    <section id="conclusion">
        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>In conclusion, the data highlights clear trends in social media usage
            and its impact on adolescent well-being. Platforms with engagement-
            driven algorithms, like Instagram and TikTok, are the most widely used
            but are often linked to LS for certain groups, particularly female and
            non-binary users. In contrast, platforms like Discord and Reddit, while
            less popular, offer community-based spaces that may serve as safe
            environments for marginalised users, though they do not always
            correlate with higher LS.
            Overall, the findings suggest that the design and nature of each
            platform significantly influence user well-being. While the data
            provides valuable insights into these trends, the conclusions should be
            considered within the context of the study’s methodology to fully
            understand social media’s impact on adolescent life satisfaction</p>
